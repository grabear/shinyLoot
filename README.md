# shinyLoot

The goal of shinyLoot is to streamline the process of inventorying loot in popular
tabletop RPG games like Paizo's Pathfinder or Starfinder.

The main purpose of this project is to allow the user to create saved loot inventories
on a per campaign basis via a shiny interface.  This will help streamline the
loot "accounting" process, which can take a lot of time.  The user will be able to 
categorize loot based on the type of loot (CASH, jewels, armor, weapons, etc.) as
well as the encounter that it was found in.

Persistent data storage will initially be achieved with Google Drive/Sheets, 
which will also provide a means for authentication.

# Other Goals

* Prefilled items based on past loot inventory.
* Multi-User Interface.
    * Need/Greed/Pass/Sell/Other Voting options.
    * Notifiations.
    * Player Profiles
      * Loot preferences (Strength items vs Wisdom items)
